# LZW compression

Simple version of **LZW compression** algorithm written in **C++** creating dictionary codes for LZW (displayed as decimal values instead of binary codes) and converting input text to coded values (although still in integer values because the main objective of this simplistic version was only to create codes instead of actual compression).
